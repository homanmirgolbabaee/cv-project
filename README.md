Add background subtraction


#### Car Segmentation

Current: Basic implementation exists ✓
Missing:

Pedestrian filtering
Robustness improvements
Proper classification of correctly/incorrectly parked cars


#### 2D Top-view Visualization

Current: Basic implementation exists ✓
Missing:

Dynamic homography computation
More accurate space representation

### Performance Metrics (CRITICAL MISSING COMPONENT)
